  I develop exquisite   <strong> Web applications </strong> using the well-crafted latest technology available. Currently, I'm Working on one of my ambitious <strong>start-up ideas</strong>. 
  I've been passionate about technology and the internet since childhood, and my overwhelming curiosity for computers led me to Computer Science for Education.
  Thus my general interest in technology growing immensly as my knowledge is increasing with it. It always fascinates me how incredible it is. That's why I always find myself in the documentation when  new technologies appear,

  They say <em> "Knowledge has a beginning but no end" </em>, that's why I always drive into what's next. But remember that <em><strong> Ignorance is the curse of God;</strong> </em>
